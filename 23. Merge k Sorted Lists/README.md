### 23. Merge k Sorted Lists

https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/

You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

```
Example 1:

Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
```

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next


class Solution:
    def mergeKLists(self, lists: List[Optional[ListNode]]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        out = []
        for head in lists:
            while head:
                out.append(head.val)
                head = head.next
        out.sort()
        d = n = ListNode()
        for i in out:
            n.next = ListNode(i)
            n = n.next
        return d.next
 ```
