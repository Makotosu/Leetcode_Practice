### 547. Number of Provinces

There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

Return the total number of provinces.

The time complexity of the DFS algorithm is represented in the form of O(V + E), where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges.

```
Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2

Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3
```
```
class Solution:
    def findCircleNum(self, isConnected: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def dfs(start):
            visited.add(start)
            for end in range(len(isConnected)):
                if isConnected[start][end] and end not in visited:
                    dfs(end)
        
        num = 0
        visited = set()
        for start in range(len(isConnected)):
            if start not in visited:
                num += 1
                dfs(start)
        
        return num
