### 112. Path Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.

A leaf is a node with no children.

```
Example1
Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
Output: true
Explanation: The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.
```

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

    """

    def hasPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], target: int) -> bool:
        if root is None:
            return False
        if root.left is None and root.right is None:
            return target == root.val
        return self.hasPathSum( root.left, target - root.val) or self.hasPathSum(root.right, target - root.val)
```
